## Sovereign cognitive infrastructure for regulated decision-making

ATLANTYQA combines local-first integration, governance, and compliance so every institution can adopt AI without losing control or trust. This page acts as the single hub for public and regulated sectors; each subsection summarizes what already exists in the one-pagers and landing drafts, focusing on what each committee needs to see.
