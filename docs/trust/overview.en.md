# Trust & Governance

ATLANTYQA demonstrates governance in every deployment: clear controls, continuous evidence, and reproducible models. This document gathers the assets that institutions demand for measurable trust.

## Trust Pack Contents

1. Downloadable sector one-pagers (EU, municipal, regulated).  
2. Security & Compliance overview with SBOM/SCA, logs, hardening, and data residency.  
3. Deployment models for micro-CPDs and edge nodes.  
4. Use cases with audit and operational KPIs.

## Implementation and quality commitment

- Every public-offer implementation is defined with a minimum timeline of **180 days**.
- A **30-day** operational contingency buffer is reserved for unexpected incidents.
- Each phase closes with quality gates: UAT, security, compliance, and traceable evidence.

Share the Trust Pack with committees, RFPs, and procurement squads.
