# Security & Compliance

ATLANTYQA combines security into daily operations:
- SBOM/SCA inside pipelines (`release-draft.yml`, `jsonl-validate-wizard.sh`).
- Logs and evidence in `bot-review.yml` / `outputs/bot-evidence`.
- Runtime hardening (see `docs/internal/examples/hardening-note.md`).
- Secure data flows described in `docs/trust/deployment-models.md`.
