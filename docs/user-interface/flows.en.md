# Workflows: Ingestion and Analysis

The Cognitive Suite optimizes the data lifecycle through an intuitive flow that
transforms raw documents into actionable and persistent knowledge.

## 📥 Multimodal ingestion

The process starts on the **"New Document"** screen, designed for fast and
labeled upload:

### Input form
* **File**: Selector compatible with PDF, DOCX, TXT, JSON, YAML.
* **Metadata**: Descriptive title, corporate tags, and predefined category.
* **Description**: Brief context to improve initial analysis accuracy.

### Upload states
1. **Queued**: Document received and waiting for an available worker.
2. **Processing**: Semantic ingestion and chunking.
3. **Completed**: Knowledge ready for querying.
4. **Error**: Parsing failure or security validation failure.

## 🧠 Semantic analysis results

Once processed, the system presents a detailed view focused on cognitive value:

### Value sections
* **Automatic summary**: Key points and high-level insights generated by local AI.
* **Smart classifications**: Detection of risks, opportunities, and compliance.
* **Entity extraction**: Automatic identification of people, organizations, dates, and places.
* **Decision timeline**: Temporal mapping of insights based on document structure.

### Post-analysis actions
From the results view, the user can:
* **Export**: Download the report in Markdown or PDF.
* **Correct**: Adjust tags and classifications manually.
* **Integrate**: Start the GitOps flow to persist the result.
